This code accompanies the manuscript entitled "The synaptic proteome of autism across postnatal development in primary visual cortex."
Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we characterized protein levels in postmortem primary visual cortex synaptosome enrichments from 31 autistic and 31 matched neurotypical individuals, aged 4 to 32.
The order of the code can be found in the code outline pdf.
